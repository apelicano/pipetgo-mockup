# PipetGo Mockup

A single-page JavaScript mockup for a laboratory service marketplace platform. This demo simulates dashboards and workflows for four roles: Customer, Laboratory, Logistics, and Administrator.

## Features

- **Role-based Dashboards:** Switch between Customer, Laboratory, Logistics, and Admin views.
- **Mock Data:** Simulated services, labs, orders, quotes, pickups, users, and transactions.
- **Dynamic UI:** Sidebar navigation, modal dialogs, status badges, and forms.
- **No Backend:** All data and logic are in `script.js` for demonstration purposes.

## Usage

1. Clone the repo.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (ensure it loads `script.js`).
3. Select a role and explore the mock dashboards.

## Structure

- `script.js`: Main logic and UI rendering.
- `index.html`: Minimal HTML shell (not included here).
- `styles.css`: WIP
